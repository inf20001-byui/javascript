# Overview

I wrote a Currency Convertor application as I was learning javascript and show how it can interact with HTML.  I also
incorporated using the moment.js Javascript CDN library to display the current time on my page.  As part of the 
learning process and how to handle data downloaded from another source, I created a random sayings app that will show
different sayings.  Since I used it as part of the learning process, I also included it on my webpage.

To run this application you simply need a web browser that support javascript.  Copy the code, including the javascript
files into a folder on you device and open the main.html file.

# Future Work

- Display images next to the different currencies
